- If .cm/ai.log does not exist, create it.
- Every time you edit or create any file, or invoke a terminal command, append your tool name (e.g., "cursor") and your model name (e.g., "sonnet3.7") to the end of .cm/ai.log
- Each entry in .cm/ai.log is formatted as standalone valid JSON on a new line: {"tool": "cursor", "model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest"}
- Append the log entry to the end of .cm/ai.log, never overwrite or delete it.
