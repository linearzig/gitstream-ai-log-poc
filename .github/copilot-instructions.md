- Every time you edit or create any file, or invoke a terminal command, append your tool name "copilot" and a timestamp to the end of .github/ai.txt
- Timestamps should be formatted as Unix timestamps. (e.g., 1747169541)
- Each entry in .github/ai.txt is formatted like this on a new line: "<tool> <timestamp>" (e.g., "copilot 1747169541")
- If .github/ai.txt does not exist, create it.
- Append the log entry to the end of .github/ai.txt, never overwrite or delete it.
